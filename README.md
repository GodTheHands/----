# Notes

## 1. Overview

This is a carefully organized collection of reading notes, covering a wide range of knowledge areas and topics.

These notes mainly cover subjects such as computer science, mathematics, and physics. The content of them is extracted from the book itself, aiming to convey the most important knowledge points in the shortest amount of text.

The significance of writing them is to help me consolidate knowledge, deepen understanding, and also to provide reference and inspiration for other people who love reading and learning.
